# FamFetcher
Here I share my code for a web-based python script.  It can be used as an example to create your own and make python scripts accessible from anywhere and to anyone. The script retrieves the species data for fish families from Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes hosted at the California Academy of Sciences and compiles a csv file.
